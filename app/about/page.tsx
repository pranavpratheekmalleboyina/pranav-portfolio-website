          Hi! Iâ€™m Pranav Pranav Malleboyina, a software professional who
          combines 5.5+ years of industry experience with advanced academic
          expertise in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Android
          Development. I honed these skills during my Masterâ€™s in Computer
          Science at Texas A&M Universityâ€“Corpus Christi, which deepened my
          ability to design data-driven, intelligent solutions.<br />
      
          Prior to my graduate studies, I worked extensively with Java, J2EE,
          Spring Boot Framework, and ASP.NET in India, contributing to the
          development and support of enterprise-level applications. My
          background covers the entire software development lifecycle â€” from
          requirement analysis and architecture design to coding, testing,
          deployment, and long-term maintenance. <br />
          
          I thrive in Agile (Scrum) environments, collaborating with
          cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, high-quality software. I
          bring strong expertise in Object-Oriented Design, hands-on experience
          with version control (GitHub, Bitbucket), and proficiency with
          collaboration and project management tools (JIRA, Confluence). I take
          pride in translating complex business requirements into innovative,
          practical solutions that drive measurable impact. <br />
        
          Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage my experience and expertise to
          contribute to cutting-edge projects, create value through technology,
          and continuously grow as a professional.<br />
        
          ðŸ“© Always open to connecting with professionals in software
          engineering, artificial intelligence, and related fields to share
          insights, explore opportunities, and collaborate on impactful
          innovations. <br />
