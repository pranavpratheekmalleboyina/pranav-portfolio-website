          Hi! I’m Pranav and I am a Computer Science student who has completed my master's degree 
          at Texas A&M University–Corpus Christi,
          with 5+ years of experience as a backend engineer in Java Springboot and .NET.
          My expertise spreads across Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose), full-stack web development, and Python/ML.
          I enjoy building products that are reliable, scalable, and intuitive for users.
